**Ashesi University**  
- **Professor:** Dr. Daniel Addo
- **Student:** Daniel Eta

## Repository Overview
This repository contains all laboratory assignments and homework for CS213 - Object Oriented Programming with Java. Each lab/assignment explores fundamental programming concepts including variables, data types, control structures, and object-oriented principles through practical football/soccer-themed applications.

### Labs
- [`Lab-01-Cohort-A/`](Lab-01-Cohort-A/) - [Ashesi Premier League Activity - Football Player Management System]

#### Lab-01-Cohort-A: Football Player Management System
This lab introduces fundamental Java programming concepts through a football player management application. Students work with variables, data types, input/output operations, conditional statements, and switch cases.

**Files and Tasks:**
- [`FootballPlayer.java`](Lab-01-Cohort-A/src/FootballPlayer.java) - Comprehensive player analysis (Tasks 1-9)
  - **Task 1:** Basic player information input and display
  - **Task 2:** Unit conversions (pounds to kg, meters to cm)
  - **Task 3:** Pre/post increment and decrement operations
  - **Task 4:** Boolean logic and eligibility checking (AND, OR, NOT operators)
  - **Task 5:** Conditional statements for player classification (rising star, prime, veteran)
  - **Task 6:** Switch statement for position determination by jersey number
  - **Task 7:** Enhanced switch with multiple case values
  - **Task 8:** Nested conditionals for starting lineup decisions
  - **Task 9:** Ternary operator for final play/rest decision

- [`CombinedPlayerPicker.java`](Lab-01-Cohort-A/src/CombinedPlayerPicker.java) - Integrated player evaluation system (Task 10)
  - **Task 10:** Complete player evaluation combining all previous concepts
  - Determines position, attacking role, eligibility, and lineup status
  - Provides comprehensive player report with final recommendations

## How to Run
Each lab/assignment contains a `src/` folder with Java source files.

```bash
# Example: To run Lab-01-Cohort-A
cd Lab-01-Cohort-A/src
javac *.java

# Run FootballPlayer (Tasks 1-9)
java FootballPlayer

# Run CombinedPlayerPicker (Task 10)
java CombinedPlayerPicker
```
